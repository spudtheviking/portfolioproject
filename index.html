  <h2>About Jesse</h2>
  <p>After graduating high school I started working as a line cook to make ends meet. I've always been fascinated by computers and the progression of software so I started my software engineering journey at a local community college.</p>
  <p>As a student at <a href="https://www.thinkful.com/">Thinkful</a>, I've started my journey as a software developer and I couldn't be more excited to see what I work on next.</p>
  <p>If you're looking to have a highly driven and cooperative new developer be a part of your team please reach out!</p>
